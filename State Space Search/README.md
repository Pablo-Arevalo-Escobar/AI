Description: Experiment with state space searcha algorithms with Python
Instructions to run experiment:
	1	Step 1
	◦	Clone or Download the COMP_472.pynb file with the experiment code to your system from Moodle/Github.
	2	Step 2
	◦	Using Jupyter Notebooks, navigate to the directory of the copied files.
	◦	Open file with Jupyter Notebooks.
	3	Step 3
	◦	Ensure that the dataset file is in the same directory as the experiment code.
	4	Step 4
	◦	Select 'Cell' and 'Run all' in the header of Jupyter Notebooks to run the code.
	◦	Give time to allow for processing.
	◦	View Output files in the same directory as experiment code.
